# ConnectedDrive Lite

### Overview

ConnectedDrive Lite is a digital platform that helps BMW drivers discover, activate, and manage in-car features easily. It simplifies the BMW ConnectedDrive experience for users who are unaware of its capabilities or face internet and payment limitations.

### What It Does

ConnectedDrive Lite allows BMW owners to:

- Log in with their BMW ID, VIN, or email.  
- See available, new, and expiring digital features.  
- Try premium features through guided demos.  
- Activate or renew features directly from their dashboard.  
- Work offline by queuing upgrades until internet access returns.
